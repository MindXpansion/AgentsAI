## üß¨ What Are AI Agents?

**AI Agents** are autonomous programs that perceive their environment, reason about it, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

In our context, they:

* Use **LLMs (like GPT-4)** for reasoning.
* Interact via **tools, APIs, or prompts**.
* Operate **individually** or in **multi-agent systems (MAS)**.

## üîë Key Concepts

| Concept          | Definition                                                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Agent**        | A program that can observe, decide, and act to fulfill a goal.     |
| **Tool**         | An external API, function, or service the agent can call.          |
| **LLM**          | The language model (e.g. GPT-4) that powers the agent's reasoning. |
| **Memory**       | Stores past interactions or decisions for context-aware reasoning. |
| **Environment**  | The space in which agents act (can be abstract or interactive).    |
| **Autonomy**     | Degree to which agents act without human intervention.             |
| **Coordination** | How multiple agents collaborate or negotiate tasks.                |

## üõ† Agent Frameworks Overview

### ‚úÖ CrewAI

* Designed for **multi-agent collaboration**.
* Inspired by a "movie crew" metaphor: Director, Researcher, Writer, etc.
* Focus on **structured agent roles** and **delegation**.

### ‚úÖ SmolAgents

* Lightweight, **minimalist agent systems**.
* Emphasizes simplicity and chain-of-thought interactions.
* Good for **local-first**, single-agent logic.

---

## üë• CrewAI Basics

```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew
```

* **Agents** are defined by roles, goals, and tools.
* **Crew** handles orchestration and task management.

**Example Roles:**

* `ResearchAgent`: Fetches data via search APIs.
* `WriterAgent`: Generates structured summaries.

**Key Concepts:**

* Task delegation
* Parallelism
* Agent communication

---

## üß± SmolAgents Basics

```python
from smolagents import SmolAgent
```

* Build **single-purpose agents** that use **functions as tools**.
* Focus on **reasoning chains** and **context prompts**.

**Example Workflow:**

* Give agent a goal ‚Üí Agent reasons through steps ‚Üí Calls functions.

---

## üîç Real-World Use Cases

* Research assistants
* Code generation and refactoring
* Data summarization and extraction
* Automated proposal drafting
* AI-driven agents for customer support or product development

## ‚Ü∫ Design Patterns for Agents

| Pattern              | Description                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Reflex Agent**     | Reacts to current input (stateless)       |
| **Utility Agent**    | Chooses actions based on expected utility |
| **Planner Agent**    | Plans a sequence of steps to meet a goal  |
| **Team Agents**      | Coordinate tasks among multiple agents    |
| **Chain-of-Thought** | Use intermediate reasoning steps          |

---

## üöÄ Advanced Topics

* Tool execution tracing
* Memory-enabled agents (e.g., via vector DBs)
* Long-term planning
* Autonomy toggling & human-in-the-loop
* Fine-tuning tools and prompts
* Agent evaluation frameworks
